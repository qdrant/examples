    "Qdrant is an Open-Source Vector Database and Vector Search Engine written in Rust. It provides fast and scalable vector similarity search service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a search engine using the `Quora Duplicate Questions` dataset and the `Qdrant library`. It aims to identify similar questions based on user input queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed overview of implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the Quora Dataset and apply preprocessing steps.\n",
    "- Vectorize the textual data and store in a vector space, where questions entered by users can be vectorized and compared in the same vector space - All these steps are covered by internal functionality of Qdrant.\n",
    "- Several example queries are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the notebook demonstrates how easily and efficiently, complete search engine can be created using Qdrant Vector Database and Client.\n",
