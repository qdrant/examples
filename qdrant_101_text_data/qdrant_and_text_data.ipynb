        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.

In the context of NLP, vectors are numerical representations of words, sentences, or documents that capture their semantic meaning. These vector representations, often referred to as word embeddings or document embeddings, transform textual data into a numerical format that machines can easily process and analyze.\n",
        "\n",
        "Vector databases serve as efficient storage systems for these vector representations, allowing for fast and accurate similarity searches. They enable users to find similar words, sentences, or documents based on their semantic meaning rather than relying solely on exact matches or keywords. By organizing vectors in a way that facilitates quick retrieval and comparison, Vector databases are instrumental in powering various NLP applications, including information retrieval, recommendation systems, semantic search, and content clustering.\n",

These three models are part of a family of deep learning architectures called [transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Transformers are known for their ability to learn long-range dependencies between words in a sentence. This ability to learn from text makes them well-suited for tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. The transformers architecture has been incredibly influential in the field of machine learning, and one of the tools at the heart of this is the [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformer models work by using a technique called attention, which allows them to focus on different parts of a sentence when making predictions. For example, if you are trying to translate a sentence from English to Spanish, the transformer model will use attention to focus on the words in the English sentence that are most important for the translation into Spanish.\n",
        "\n",
        "One analogy that can be used to explain transformer models is to think of them as a group of people who are trying to solve a puzzle. Each person in the group is given a different piece of the puzzle, and they need to work together to figure out how the pieces fit together. The transformer model is like the group of people, and the attention mechanism is like the way that the people in the group communicate with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformers are essential to this tutorial. Your initial task is to 1) load sample data, 2) transform it and 3) create embeddings. You will then store the embeddings 4) in the Qdrant vector database and 5) retrieve the data using a recommendation system."

        "First, you will need to set a padding token for GPT-2. In natural language processing (NLP), padding refers to adding extra tokens to make all input sequences the same length. When processing text data, it's common for sentences or documents to have different lengths. However, many machine learning models require fixed-size inputs. Padding solves this issue by adding special tokens (such as zeros) to the shorter sequences, making them equal in length to the longest sequence in the dataset. For example, say you have a set of sentences and you want to process them using a model that requires fixed-length input, you may pad the sequences to match the length of the longest sentence, let's say five tokens. The padded sentences would look like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. \"I love cats\" -> \"I love cats [PAD] [PAD]\"\n",
        "2. \"Dogs are friendly\" -> \"Dogs are friendly [PAD]\"\n",
        "3. \"Birds can fly\" -> \"Birds can fly [PAD] [PAD]\"\n",
        "\n",
        "By padding the sequences, you ensure that all inputs have the same size, allowing the model to process them uniformly. Because GPT-2 does not have a padding token, we will use the \"end of text\" token instead."

        "In this tutorial you have learned that (1) vector databases provide efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors, making them ideal for similarity-based search tasks. (2) Natural language processing enables us to understand and process human language, opening up possibilities for different kinds of useful applications for digital technologies. (3) Transformers, with their attention mechanism, capture long-range dependencies in language and achieve incredible results in different tasks. Finally, embeddings encode words or sentences into dense vectors, capturing semantic relationships and enabling powerful language understanding.\n",
