    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves teaching computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. NLP techniques can help us with tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and language generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector Databases, on the other hand, are a type of database that specializes in storing and querying high-dimensional vectors. In the context of NLP, vectors are numerical representations of words, sentences, or documents that capture their semantic meaning. These vector representations, often referred to as word embeddings or document embeddings, transform textual data into a numerical format that machines can easily process and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector Databases serve as efficient storage systems for these vector representations, allowing for fast and accurate similarity search. They enable users to find similar words, sentences, or documents based on their semantic meaning rather than relying solely on exact matches or keywords. By organizing vectors in a way that facilitates quick retrieval and comparison, Vector Databases are instrumental in powering various NLP applications, including information retrieval, recommendation systems, semantic search, and content clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connecting dot between NLP and Vector Databases lies in the importance of vector representations in NLP tasks. Vector representations enable NLP algorithms to understand the contextual relationships and semantic meaning of textual data. By leveraging Vector Databases, NLP systems can efficiently store and retrieve these vector representations, making it easier to process and analyze large volumes of textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we will delve deeper into the fundamentals of NLP and Vector Databases. In particular, we will learn (at a high-level) how to use transformers to create embeddings for a corpus of news, and how to use Qdrant to search and recommend the best matches to a chosen document."

    "The most common use case you will find at the time of writing, will likely involve large language models. You might have heard of models like [GPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4), [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex), and [PaLM-2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2) which are powering incredible tools such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), and [Bard](https://bard.google.com/?hl=en), respectively. These three models are part of a family of deep learning architectures called [transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), which are known for their ability to learn long-range dependencies between words in a sentence. This ability to learn from text makes them well-suited for tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer models work by using a technique called attention, which allows them to focus on different parts of a sentence when making predictions. For example, if you are trying to translate a sentence from English to Spanish, the transformer model will use attention to focus on the words in the English sentence that are most important for the translation into Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "One analogy that can be used to explain transformer models is to think of them as a group of people who are trying to solve a puzzle. Each person in the group is given a different piece of the puzzle, and they need to work together to figure out how the pieces fit together. The transformer model is like the group of people, and the attention mechanism is like the way that the people in the group communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more concise way, transformer models are a type of machine learning model that can learn long-range dependencies between words in a sentence by using (or paying 😉) attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, vector databases are used to store word embeddings. Word embeddings are vector representations of words that capture their semantic meaning, and these are used to improve the performance of different NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformers architecture has been incredibly influential in the field of machine learning, and one of the tools at the heart of this is the [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library developed by the Hugging Face team. With it, getting embeddings from a corpus of text can be done in a very straightforward way.\n",

    "Tokenization is like breaking down a sentence into smaller pieces called \"tokens.\" These tokens can be words, numbers, curly brackets, or even punctuation marks. This process helps computers understand and analyze text more easily because they can treat each token as a separate unit and work with them individually.\n",

    "The model we will use to tokenize our news articles and extract the embeddings is [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2). GPT-2 is a powerful language model created by OpenAI, and it is like a smart computer program that has been trained on a lot of text from the internet. You can think of it as an AI that can generate human-like text and answer questions based on what it has learned. GPT-2 can be used for a variety of things, like writing articles, creating chatbots, generating story ideas, or even helping with language translation.\n",

    "Before we walk through an example of tokenization and embedding extraction, we will need to set a padding token for GPT-2. In natural language processing (NLP), padding refers to adding extra tokens to make all input sequences the same length. When processing text data, it's common for sentences or documents to have different lengths. However, many machine learning models require fixed-size inputs. Padding solves this issue by adding special tokens (such as zeros) to the shorter sequences, making them equal in length to the longest sequence in the dataset. For example, say you have a set of sentences and you want to process them using a model that requires fixed-length input, you may pad the sequences to match the length of the longest sentence, let's say five tokens. The padded sentences would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"I love cats\" -> \"I love cats [PAD] [PAD]\"\n",
    "2. \"Dogs are friendly\" -> \"Dogs are friendly [PAD]\"\n",
    "3. \"Birds can fly\" -> \"Birds can fly [PAD] [PAD]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "By padding the sequences, you ensure that all inputs have the same size, allowing the model to process them uniformly. Because GPT-2 does not have a padding token, we will use the \"end of text\" token instead."

    "In conclusion, we have explored a bit of the fascinating world of vector databases, natural language processing, transformers, and embeddings. In this tutorial we learned that (1) vector databases provide efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors, making them ideal for similarity-based search tasks. (2) Natural language processing enables us to understand and process human language, opening up possibilities for different kinds of useful applications for digital technologies. (3) Transformers, with their attention mechanism, capture long-range dependencies in language and achieve incredible results in different tasks. Finally, embeddings encode words or sentences into dense vectors, capturing semantic relationships and enabling powerful language understanding.\n",

    "By combining these technologies, we can unlock new levels of language understanding, information retrieval, and intelligent systems that continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of AI."
