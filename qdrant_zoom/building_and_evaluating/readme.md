Now that we've gotten our data, stored it in a vector database and built a RAG app, we need to evaluate the performance of the different retrieval methods.

We'll use a simple evaluation metric, the percentage of correct results.

We'll evaluate the performance of the different retrieval methods by searching for a random meeting and checking if the retrieved results contain the correct meeting.

We'll do this for 30 random meetings and report the percentage of correct results.

Then we will explore the results and use the best retrieval method for our application in deployment.
