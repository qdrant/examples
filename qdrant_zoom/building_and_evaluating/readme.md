# Qdrant Zoom: Building and Evaluating Retrieval Methods

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to build and evaluate different retrieval methods for the Qdrant Zoom RAG application.

## Contents

This notebook covers the following key aspects:

1. Evaluation of retrieval methods using Qdrant and stored Zoom meeting data
2. Comparison of different retrieval approaches (dense, sparse, and hybrid)
3. Performance analysis using a simple metric: percentage of correct results
4. Exploration of results to determine the best retrieval method for deployment

## Key Features

- Implements multiple retrieval methods using Qdrant
- Evaluates performance by searching for random meetings
- Uses a sample size of 30 random meetings for comprehensive testing
- Reports the percentage of correct results for each method
- Provides insights for selecting the optimal retrieval approach for deployment

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have completed the data retrieval and storage steps from the previous part
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in this directory
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions to evaluate retrieval methods

## Next Steps

After completing the evaluation process, use the insights gained to implement the best-performing retrieval method in the deployment phase of the project.
