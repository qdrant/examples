    "    Qdrant can use one of two options for [storage](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/storage/): \n",
    "    - **in-memory** storage, which stores all vectors in RAM and has the highest speed since disk access is required only for persistence)\n",
    "    - **memmap** storage, which creates a virtual address space associated with the file on disk. You can have a look at that directory in a *nix system with `tree qdrant_storage -L 2`, and something similar to the following output should come up for you.\n",

    "        └── raft_state\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. You used `client.recreate_collection()`, which can be used more than once to create new collections with or without the same name. Therefore, please make sure you do not run this command multiple times and accidentally recreate a collection. \n",
    "\n",

    "A recommendation system is a technology that suggests items or content to users based on their preferences, interests, or past behavior. In its most widely-used form, recommendation systems work by analyzing data about you and other users. The system looks at your previous choices, such as movies you've watched, products you've bought, or articles you've read. It then compares this information with data from other people who have similar tastes or interests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such systems are used in various companies such as Netflix, Amazon, Tik-Tok, and Spotify. They aim to personalize your experience, save you time searching for things you might like, or introduce you to new and relevant content that you may not have discovered otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qdrant's API supports such a system, letting you account for user feedback. For example, you can recommend songs based on user likes (👍) or exclude similar ones to content users have disliked (👎).\n",

    "- `negative=` - optionally, specify the `id` of disliked songs to exclude other semantically similar songs\n",
    "- `positive=` - in case of liked songs, specify their `id` to exclude similar songs (required)\n",

Even if you get 5 vectors back, it might be more useful to show random results, rather than vectors that are 0.012 similar to the query vector. With this in mind, you can actually set a threshold for our vectors with the `score_threshold=` parameter."

    "To wrap up, we have explored a bit of the fascinating world of vector databases, and we learned that these databases provide efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors, making them ideal for similarity-based search tasks and recommendation systems. Both of these use cases can be applied in a variety of industries while helping us unlock new levels of information retrieval. In particular, recommendation systems built with Qdrant provide developers with enough flexibility to add and subtract data points that users liked or disliked, respectively, and even set up a threshold for how similar a recommendation must be before our applications can serve it.\n",
