    "Combining Qdrant and LlamaIndex to keep Q&A systems up-to-date\n",
    "---\n",
    "#  Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever been frustrated with an answer engine that is stuck in the past? As our world rapidly evolves, the accuracy of information changes accordingly. Traditional models can become outdated, providing answers that were once accurate but are now obsolete. The cost of outdated knowledge can be high - misinforming users, impacting decision-making, and ultimately undermining trust in your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qdrant and LlamaIndex work together seamlessly, continually adapting your engine to the relentless pace of information change. By mastering these tools, you can transform your applications from static knowledge repositories into dynamic, adaptable knowledge machines. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or an AI enthusiast, join us on this learning journey - the future of answer engines is here, and it's time to embrace it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1️⃣ How to build a question-answering system using LlamaIndex and Qdrant.\n",
    "    - We will load a news dataset, store it with Qdrant client, and load the data into LlamaIndex.\n",
    "- 2️⃣ How to keep the QA engine updated and improve the ranking system.\n",
    "    - We will define two postprocessors: Recency and Cohere Rerank; and use these to create various query engines.\n",
    "- 3️⃣ How to use Node Sources in LlamaIndex to investigate questions and sources on which the answers are based.\n",
    "    - We will query these engines with various questions and compare their responses.\n"

    "\n",
    "Main Tools\n",
    "1. `llama_index`: A powerful tool for building large-scale information retrieval systems. [Learn More](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/starter_example.html) \n",
    "2. `qdrant_client`: A high-performance vector database designed for storing and searching large-scale high-dimensional vectors. In this tutorial, we use Qdrant as our vector storage system.\n",
    "3. `cohere`: A key reranking service to be used in postprocessing. It takes in a query and a list of texts and returns an ordered array with each text assigned a _new_ relevance score.\n",
    "4. `OpenAI`: Important for answer generation, as it takes the top few candidates to produce a final answer.\n",
    "5. `datasets`: Library necessary to import our dataset.\n",
    "6. `pandas`: Relevant library for data manipulation and analysis.\n"
