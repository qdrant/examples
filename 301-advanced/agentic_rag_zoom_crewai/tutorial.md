# Understanding Agentic RAG: A Hands-on Tutorial

By combining the power of Qdrant for vector search and CrewAI for orchestrating modular agents, you can build systems that don't just answer questions but analyze, interpret, and act.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through building an Agentic RAG system step by step. By the end, you'll have a working framework for storing data in a Qdrant Vector Database and extracting insights using CrewAI agents in conjunction with Vector Search over your data.

## Why Agentic RAG?

Traditional RAG systems focus on fetching data and generating responses, but they lack the ability to reason deeply or handle multi-step processes. Agentic RAG solves this by combining:

- RAG's power to retrieve relevant data using vector search
- AI agents' ability to analyze and synthesize information using modular workflows and custom tools

Think of it like upgrading from a librarian who retrieves books to a research assistant who not only finds the books but also summarizes and interprets them for you.

## What You'll Build

In this hands-on tutorial, we'll create a system that:

1. Uses Qdrant to store and retrieve meeting transcripts as vector embeddings
2. Leverages CrewAI agents to analyze and summarize meeting data
3. Presents insights in a simple Streamlit interface for easy interaction

### **Technical Details**

Our system combines vector search with AI agents to create a powerful meeting analysis tool. Let's walk through how each component works together.

### **Key Components**

1. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Processes meeting transcripts and metadata
   - Creates embeddings with SentenceTransformer
   - Manages Qdrant collection and data upload

2. **AI Agent System**
   - Implements CrewAI agent logic
   - Handles vector search integration
   - Processes queries with Claude

3. **User Interface**
   - Provides chat-like web interface
   - Shows real-time processing feedback
   - Maintains conversation history

---

### **The Data Pipeline**

At the heart of our system is the data processing pipeline. We use a singleton pattern to ensure efficient resource usage:

```python
class MeetingData:
    def _initialize(self):
        self.data_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent / 'data'
        self.meetings = self._load_meetings()

        self.qdrant_client = QdrantClient(
            url=os.getenv('QDRANT_URL'),
            api_key=os.getenv('QDRANT_API_KEY')
        )
        self.embedding_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
```

When processing meetings, we need to consider both the content and context. Each meeting gets converted into a rich text representation before being transformed into a vector:

```python
text_to_embed = f"""
    Topic: {meeting.get('topic', '')}
    Content: {meeting.get('vtt_content', '')}
    Summary: {json.dumps(meeting.get('summary', {}))}
"""
```

This structured format ensures our vector embeddings capture the full context of each meeting. But processing meetings one at a time would be inefficient. Instead, we batch process our data:

```python
batch_size = 100
for i in range(0, len(points), batch_size):
    batch = points[i:i + batch_size]
    self.qdrant_client.upsert(
        collection_name='zoom_recordings',
        points=batch
    )
```

### Building the AI Agent System

Our AI system uses a tool-based approach. Let's start with the simplest tool - a calculator for meeting statistics:

```python
class CalculatorTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "calculator"
    description: str = "Perform basic mathematical calculations"

    def _run(self, a: int, b: int) -> dict:
        return {
            "addition": a + b,
            "multiplication": a * b
        }
```

But the real power comes from our vector search integration. This tool converts natural language queries into vector representations and searches our meeting database:

```python
class SearchMeetingsTool(BaseTool):
    def _run(self, query: str) -> List[Dict]:
        response = openai_client.embeddings.create(
            model="text-embedding-ada-002",
            input=query
        )
        query_vector = response.data[0].embedding

        return self.qdrant_client.search(
            collection_name='zoom_recordings',
            query_vector=query_vector,
            limit=10
        )
```

The search results then feed into our analysis tool, which uses Claude to provide deeper insights:

```python
class MeetingAnalysisTool(BaseTool):
    def _run(self, meeting_data: dict) -> Dict:
        meetings_text = self._format_meetings(meeting_data)

        message = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
            messages=[{
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"Analyze these meetings:\n\n{meetings_text}"
            }]
        )
```

### Orchestrating the Workflow

The magic happens when we bring these tools together under our agent framework. We create two specialized agents:

```python
researcher = Agent(
    role='Research Assistant',
    goal='Find and analyze relevant information',
    tools=[calculator, searcher, analyzer]
)

synthesizer = Agent(
    role='Information Synthesizer',
    goal='Create comprehensive and clear responses'
)
```

These agents work together in a coordinated workflow. The researcher gathers and analyzes information, while the synthesizer creates clear, actionable responses. This separation of concerns allows each agent to focus on its strengths.

### Building the User Interface

The Streamlit interface provides a clean, chat-like experience for interacting with our AI system. Let's start with the basic setup:

```python
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Meeting Assistant",
    page_icon="ðŸ¤–",
    layout="wide"
)
```

To make the interface more engaging, we add custom styling that makes the output easier to read:

```python
st.markdown("""
    <style>
    .stApp {
        max-width: 1200px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
    .output-container {
        background-color: #f0f2f6;
        padding: 20px;
        border-radius: 10px;
        margin: 10px 0;
    }
    </style>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

One of the key features is real-time feedback during processing. We achieve this with a custom output handler:

```python
class ConsoleOutput:
    def __init__(self, placeholder):
        self.placeholder = placeholder
        self.buffer = []
        self.update_interval = 0.5  # seconds
        self.last_update = time.time()

    def write(self, text):
        self.buffer.append(text)
        if time.time() - self.last_update > self.update_interval:
            self._update_display()
```

This handler buffers the output and updates the display periodically, creating a smooth user experience. When a user sends a query, we process it with visual feedback:

```python
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
    message_placeholder = st.empty()
    progress_bar = st.progress(0)
    console_placeholder = st.empty()

    try:
        console_output = ConsoleOutput(console_placeholder)
        with contextlib.redirect_stdout(console_output):
            progress_bar.progress(0.3)
            full_response = get_crew_response(prompt)
            progress_bar.progress(1.0)
```

The interface maintains a chat history, making it feel like a natural conversation:

```python
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.markdown(message["content"])
```

We also include helpful examples and settings in the sidebar:

```python
with st.sidebar:
    st.header("Settings")
    search_limit = st.slider("Number of results", 1, 10, 5)

    analysis_depth = st.select_slider(
        "Analysis Depth",
        options=["Basic", "Standard", "Detailed"],
        value="Standard"
    )
```

This combination of features creates an interface that's both powerful and approachable. Users can see their query being processed in real-time, adjust settings to their needs, and maintain context through the chat history.
