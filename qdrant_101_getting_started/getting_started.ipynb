    "- **in-memory** storage, which stores all vectors in RAM and has the highest speed since disk access is required only for persistence)\n",
    "- **memmap** storage, which creates a virtual address space associated with the file on disk. You can have a look at that directory in a *nix system with `tree qdrant_storage -L 2`, and something similar to the following output should come up for you.\n",

    "    ```\n",

It then compares this information with data from other people who have similar tastes or interests. \n",

    "To wrap up, we have explored a bit of the fascinating world of vector databases, and we learned that these databases provide efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors, making them ideal for similarity-based search tasks and recommendation systems. Both of these use cases can be applied in a variety of industries while helping us unlock new levels of information retrieval. In particular, recommendation systems built with Qdrant provide developers with enough flexibility to add and subtract data points that users liked or dislike, respectively, and even set up a threshold for how similar a recommendation must be before our applications can serve it.\n",
