    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenAI and Qdrant\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ever-evolving landscape of AI, the consistency and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain a challenge. While these models can understand statistical relationships between words, they often fail to provide accurate factual responses. Because their internal knowledge may not be accurate, outputs can range from spot-on to nonsensical. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework designed to bolster the accuracy of LLMs by grounding them in external knowledge bases. In this example, we'll demonstrate a streamlined  implementation of the RAG pipeline using only Qdrant and OpenAI SDKs. By harnessing Flag embedding's power, we can bypass additional frameworks' overhead. \n",
    "    \n",
    "This example assumes you understand the architecture necessary to carry out RAG. If this is new to you, please look at some introductory readings:\n",

      "2. Web Framework: A web framework helps in developing web applications efficiently. Popular choices include Flask (Python) or Spring Boot (Java).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Embedding Models: You would need vector embedding models to represent your data for search. Some popular models include Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT, depending on your application domain and requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Vector Embedding Libraries: To work with vector embeddings effectively, you may need libraries like TensorFlow, Gensim, or PyTorch to load and manipulate the embeddings.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Database: You would require a database to store and retrieve the information you want to search. Common choices include MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Search Engine: You need a tool or library to enable efficient searching using vector embeddings. Tools like Elasticsearch or Apache Solr can be integrated to perform vector similarity searches.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. API Development: To expose your web service functionality, you may need to develop an API. Popular frameworks like Flask or Django (Python) or Express (Node.js) can assist in creating the API endpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Deployment Environment: You would need a hosting environment to deploy your web service. Options include cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure, or you can choose a self-hosted solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to choose the tools that best suit your requirements, taking into account factors like programming language proficiency, scalability, and performance needs.\n"
